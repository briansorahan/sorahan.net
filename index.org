I am a software developer and musical tinkerer currently living in Austin, TX.

I am a big supporter of Linux and FLOSS software development.

I used to write lots of music with Propellerheads Reason [fn:1] (which is *a lot* of fun by the way)
but since about 2011 have been only using Linux to make music.
